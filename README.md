# MLNLP-Disaster-or-Not-Disaster
MLNLP Disaster or Not Disaster project aims to classify tweets as disaster-related or not disaster-related using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The dataset provided (train.csv) contains tweet text along with metadata such as keywords and locations, with the target column indicating the class label.  Text preprocessing steps like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF/word embeddings) are applied before training models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning approaches. The goal is to build an accurate classifier that can automatically detect real disaster tweets to support emergency response efforts.
